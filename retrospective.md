# Project Retrospective


## Lessons Learned

- Wireframe early and really think through the project
- Plan the code... Pseudocode.
    - Do the hardest, most important things first
    - Look at other examples to see how it was implemented
- Utilize free libraries, make sure to plan which to use beforehand (i.e., [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/))
- Priority matrix, ensure everything is on the page before styling
- Project worksheets are helpful
- Overestimate how much time things will take
    - Time management, time box, take breaks
- Keep code clean
- Use `git status` to see what's going to be committed
- Frequently push code, check all pages/functionality after each change

## Problem Areas

- Responsive nav
- Realizing when a CSS Grid would be the best option
- Making libraries work for my intended use


## Future Directions

- Clean up linked projects
- Contact form
- Move projects on home page into CSS Grid, rather than Flexbox
- "Skills" on About page
- Set favicon


## Accomplishments

- Built a portfolio 
- Responsive
- Resolving issues on my own, yet ...
- Knowing when to aask for help
- Being able to navigate a large codebase
